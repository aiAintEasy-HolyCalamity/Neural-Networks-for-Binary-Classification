# Neural-Networks-for-Binary-Classification
In this hands-on assignment, I built a neural network using Tensorflow to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. To deepen my understanding I implemented the network's forward path in NumPy, revealing the inner workings of machine learning frameworks.
